# üëï Raw Line: Fashion E-commerce Website

A responsive e-commerce web application designed for the fictional fashion brand Raw Line. This project simulates an online shopping experience, from browsing a product catalogue to managing a dynamic and interactive shopping cart.

This project focuses on client-side interactivity, responsive UI design and modern front-end development practices using Bootstrap 5, JavaScript (ES6+) and custom CSS.

## üõçÔ∏è Project Overview
The primary goal of this project is to build a functional, beautiful and mobile-first front-end for an online store. It demonstrates the essential functionalities of an e-commerce platform, with a strong focus on JavaScript for managing the application's state (the shopping cart).

### This project highlights skills in:

‚úî Building responsive product grid layouts;

‚úî Implementing a dynamic shopping cart using client-side JavaScript (e.g., localStorage).

‚úî Dynamically updating UI elements (like the cart count in the navbar, item totals, and the order summary) based on user actions.

‚úî Using Bootstrap 5 for a modern responsive layout, components (like navbars and modals) and utility classes.

## ‚ú® Key Features
Responsive Product Catalogue: A clean grid layout to browse all available products.

Dynamic "Add to Cart": Users can add items to the cart directly from the catalogue page.

Shopping Cart Management: A dedicated cart page where users can:

See all added items.

Update item quantities.

Remove individual items.

Clear the entire cart.

Live Order Summary: A cart summary module that automatically recalculates the subtotal, shipping costs, and grand total as the cart changes.

Persistent Cart: The shopping cart contents are saved in localStorage, so items are not lost when the user refreshes the page or closes the browser.

Mobile-First Design: The entire site is fully responsive and optimized for desktop, tablet, and mobile viewing.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack
HTML5: Semantically structured markup.

CSS3: Custom styling for branding, product cards, and layout adjustments (style.css, catalogue.css).

JavaScript (ES6+): Core application logic, cart management, DOM manipulation, and event handling (cart.js).

Bootstrap 5: Used for the responsive grid system, navbar, buttons, cards, and utility classes.

Bootstrap Icons: Used for icons throughout the application (cart, payment methods, etc.).
